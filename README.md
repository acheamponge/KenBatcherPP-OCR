# Kenneth E. Batcher - Document Cataloging and OCR

Dr. Kenneth E. Batcher is a highly accomplished Emeritus professor of Computer Science at Kent State University.  He received many prestigious awards like the IEEE Seymour Cray and ACM/IEEE Eckert-Mauchley Award, discovered novel sorting algorithms like the Batcher Odd-Even Mergesort and Bitonic Sorter, and became the holder of 14 US Patents.  His work in computer science and parallel processing earned him a place in history as a father of PP-innovation.

More information can be found about him here:

- [Kenneth E. Batcher Faculty Profile]('https://www.kent.edu/cs/kenneth-e-batcher')

Unfortunately, during my time at Kent State University, Dr. Batcher passed away.  As a tribute to him and in an effort to preserve his legacy/work, the computer science department opened a project to scan, document, and curate his work for archival, posting to a memorial website, and donation to a computer science museum in Irvine, CA.

To that end, this project was created.  Although I do not know how valuable my contribution will be, it's my objective to take the scanned documents of Dr. Batcher's work and conduct an OCR-analysis.  I also intend to do some natural language processing on the results and create some interesting visualizations (like a word cloud) to potentially give the memorial website some additional depth/engagement.  In any case, I feel that by doing this work I can pay some respect to a highly esteemed man and learn more about his contribution to a field of science which I hold dear to my heart.
